üí° Example Question Logic:
If resume mentions a "Placement Readiness Analyzer" project using Streamlit:
- A good resume question would be: "In Streamlit, which function is used to cache data and prevent re-running expensive computations on every interaction? a) @st.cache_data, b) @st.memo, c) @st.experimental_singleton, d) Both a and b".
- A good HR question would be: "Your Placement Analyzer project seems interesting. If a stakeholder requested a feature you knew was technically unfeasible with Streamlit, how would you handle the conversation?" with 4 distinct diplomatic options.
- A good voice prompt would be: "Walk me through the most challenging technical problem you solved while building your Placement Readiness Analyzer."
